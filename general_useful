seq(1,4,0.25)
# go from 1 to 4 by 0.25 units increment
rep(0.1,20)
# repeats 0.1 twenty times
# first state what you want to be repeated and then how many times
sum(c(7,3,10))
# computes the sum of 7+3+10 that is 20 
sort(c(7,3,10,3,8))
# this is very useful to sort the numbers you have from lowest value to highest value 
length(c(7,3,10,3,8))
# length tells us the number of elements we have in the vector, in this example we have 5
